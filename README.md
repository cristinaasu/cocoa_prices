# Cocoa Price Forecasting with Time Series and Machine Learning Models

This project compares four forecasting models—ETS, ARIMAX, SARIMAX, and XGBoost—for predicting daily cocoa prices using weather and exchange rate data. The goal is to evaluate which methods are most effective under volatile conditions, such as the steep price surge in 2024.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `code/` — Scripts for model training and evaluation  
- `data/` — Raw and processed datasets (cocoa prices, weather, exchange rate)  
- `functions/` — Custom R functions for feature engineering and plots  
- `paper/` — Final report, written using Quarto  
- `README.md` — Project overview

## 🧾 Outputs

- Forecast accuracy metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE  
- Visual comparison of model forecasts vs. actual prices  
- Residual analysis and model diagnostics  
- Discussion on performance trade-offs and limitations
